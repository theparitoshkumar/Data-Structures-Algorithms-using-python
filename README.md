# Getting Started with Python
> “Computer programming
is an art, because it applies
accumulated knowledge
to the world, because it
requires skill and ingenuity,
and especially because
it produces objects of
beauty. A programmer who
subconsciously views himself
as an artist will enjoy what he
does and will do it better.”
– Donald Knuth
